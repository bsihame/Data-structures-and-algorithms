# I - Sorted Array
### function that takes an array as input and returns true if the array is sorted in either ascending or descending order, and false otherwise:


### - The function first initializes two boolean variables, ascending and descending, to true. It then loops through the array, comparing each element to the previous element. If an element is less than the previous element, the ascending variable is set to false. If an element is greater than the previous element, the descending variable is set to false.

### - Finally, the function returns true if either the ascending or descending variable is still true, indicating that the array is sorted in either ascending or descending order. If both variables are false, the function returns false, indicating that the array is not sorted.
